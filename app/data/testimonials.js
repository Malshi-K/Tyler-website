We can unequivocally say that we were very impressed with his professionalism and his attention to detail. He was totally in control of the whole operation and the completed project finished up better than we could have imagined, and on time. We would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Tyler for any project asked of him. There are no hidden costs; what he quotes and what you pay are the same regardless. He is utterly reliable, he listens to his client and 'goes the extra mile' to ensure his client is completely and absolutely happy with his service.",
